## The Problem
New accounts are INVISIBLE. Algorithm doesn't push original content from nobodies.

**Current stats:** 0 likes, 0 RTs on original tweets. Nobody's seeing them.

## The Solution: Reply-First Strategy

### 80% Replies / 20% Originals

For new accounts, **replies are the ONLY way to get discovered.**

When you reply to a viral tweet:
- Your reply shows up under a post with 100K+ views
- People see your funny reply → click your profile
- They like what they see → follow

---

## The Perfect Reply Formula

### 1. Find Fresh Viral Tweets
- Posted in **last 2 hours** (replies get buried on old posts)
- **50K+ views** minimum
- Topics: relationships, money, Nigerian culture, celebrity drama

### 2. Write Profile-Click-Worthy Replies
The goal: Make someone think **"Who is this guy? I need to see more"**

**Winning reply types:**
- Funnier than the original tweet
- Unexpected twist/angle
- Self-deprecating relatable humor
- Hot take that sparks sub-discussion

**Examples:**
- Original: "Men are trash" → Reply: "As a man, I can confirm. We even recycle ourselves to the same women 😭"
- Original: "Lagos traffic is hell" → Reply: "Bro I've aged 3 years on Third Mainland Bridge alone 💀"
- Original: "9-5 can never bag this" → Reply: "My 9-5 can barely bag fuel money, let's start there 😭"

### 3. Engage After Posting
- Like replies to YOUR reply
- Reply to people who respond to you
- Follow 2-3 accounts that engage
- Build relationships, not just impressions

## Timing is Everything

| Tweet Age | Reply Value |
|-----------|-------------|
| 0-30 mins | 🔥🔥🔥 GOLD - Top of replies |
| 30-60 mins | 🔥🔥 Good - Still visible |
| 1-2 hours | 🔥 Okay - Might get seen |
| 2+ hours | ❌ Skip - Reply graveyard |

---

## Daily Targets

- **15-20 quality replies** on viral tweets
- **2-3 original tweets** (only if you have fire content)
- **Follow 10-15 engaging accounts** 
- **Engage with 20+ replies/comments**

---

## Profile Optimization

When people click through, profile must convert:

- **Bio:** Short, funny, memorable
- **Pinned tweet:** Your absolute best content
- **Recent tweets:** Show range (funny, relatable, smart)
- **Profile pic:** Clear, not default

---

## Metrics to Track

Week 1-2 focus:
- Reply impressions (are people seeing them?)
- Profile visits (are people clicking through?)
- Follow ratio from replies

NOT focused on yet:
- Original tweet performance (comes later)
- Follower count (vanity metric early on)

---

## The Mindset

You're not posting into the void. You're **inserting yourself into existing conversations** where thousands of people are already watching.

Every reply is an audition. Make it count.
