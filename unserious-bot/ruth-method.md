# The Ruth Method (@it_Rutie Study)

## Core Philosophy
**Curator > Creator.** Find viral moments, add minimal caption, let media do the work.

---

## Content Mix

### 1. Media Posts (40%)
- **Always attach photo/video**
- Caption: 5-10 words MAX
- Let the media speak

**Caption Examples:**
- "God dey create. 😍"
- "Fear men. 💔"
- "This one sweet me. 🥹"
- "Prayers up. 🙏🏽"
- "He made it. ❤️"

### 2. Controversial Hot Takes (30%)
- Short statement that makes people ARGUE
- Attach photo when possible
- Don't explain yourself

**Examples:**
- "9-5 can never bag a woman like this."
- "Broke men shouldn't have girlfriends."
- "Lagos girls > Abuja girls. No debate."
- "If your man doesn't have a car, he's not your man."
- "Men will cheat and still expect loyalty."

### 3. Nostalgia/Throwback (15%)
- Old celebrity photos
- "Remember when..." energy
- Taps into shared memory

**Examples:**
- "Throwback pictures of Ayra Starr."
- "Young Davido hits different."
- "2016 Wizkid was unmatched."

### 4. Viral Replies (15%)
- Find 50K+ view tweets
- Add unexpected twist
- Not just "😂😂😂"

---

## Caption Rules

1. **Under 15 words** — ideally under 10
2. **One emoji max** — pick the right one
3. **No hashtags** — looks desperate
4. **Statement > Question** — but questions work for engagement bait
5. **Pidgin when it fits** — "God dey create" not "God is creating"

---

## Content Sources

### Celebrity Moments to Watch
- Carter Efe (Twitch streams, funny moments)
- Davido/Wizkid/Burna (any news)
- Ayra Starr, Tems, Rema
- iShowSpeed (Nigerian visits, reactions)
- Football: Nigerian players abroad
- Nollywood actors

### Where to Find Content
- Twitter Explore/Trending
- Instagram Reels (screenshot/screen record)
- TikTok viral clips
- YouTube shorts
- Other viral accounts (don't copy caption)

---

## Engagement Triggers

### What Makes People Reply
1. **Controversy** — takes a side
2. **Nostalgia** — "remember when"
3. **Beauty/Attraction** — "God dey create"
4. **Pain/Relatability** — "Fear men"
5. **Celebrity drama** — any beef or news

### What to Avoid
- Long explanations
- Multiple hashtags
- "What do you think?" every time
- Text-only posts (rarely work)
- Copying exact captions from others

---

## Posting Rhythm

- RT your own viral posts to keep them circulating
- Post media 80% of the time
- Text-only reserved for REALLY good takes
- Engage in replies of your viral posts

---

## The Formula

```
[Viral Photo/Video] + [5-10 word caption] + [One perfect emoji] = Engagement
```

**That's it. Simple beats complex.**
