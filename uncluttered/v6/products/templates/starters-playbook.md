## 📋 Idea Validation Checklist

Use this checklist before writing a single line of code. If you can't check most of these, your idea needs more exploration.

### The Problem
- [ ] I can describe the problem in one sentence
- [ ] I've experienced this problem personally (or deeply understand someone who has)
- [ ] The problem is recurring (not a one-time annoyance)
- [ ] People are currently paying to solve this problem (even with bad solutions)
- [ ] I can name 5 specific people who have this problem

### The Solution
- [ ] My solution is fundamentally different from what exists (not just "better UI")
- [ ] I can explain the value prop in under 10 seconds
- [ ] A non-technical person would understand what it does
- [ ] It solves a **core** problem, not a nice-to-have
- [ ] I can build a usable v1 in under 4 weeks

### The Market
- [ ] The target market has at least 10,000 potential users
- [ ] People in this market are already spending money on tools
- [ ] I can reach these people through 2-3 clear channels
- [ ] The market is growing (not shrinking or stagnant)
- [ ] There's a clear "hair on fire" segment who need this NOW

### Personal Fit
- [ ] I'd use this product myself
- [ ] I can commit 6+ months to this
- [ ] I have (or can quickly build) the skills needed for v1
- [ ] This aligns with where I want my career/life to go
- [ ] I'm excited about the *problem*, not just the solution

### Scoring
- **20+ checks:** Strong signal. Move to market research.
- **15-19 checks:** Promising. Dig deeper on weak areas.
- **10-14 checks:** Needs work. Validate assumptions before building.
- **Under 10:** Reconsider or pivot the idea.
