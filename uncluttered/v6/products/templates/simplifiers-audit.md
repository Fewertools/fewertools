## 🧮 Consolidation Decision Matrix

For each pair of overlapping tools, score and decide.

### Overlap Analysis

| Function | Tool A | Tool B | Winner | Reason |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| [Function 1] | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | Tool A | [Why] |
| [Function 2] | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Tool B | [Why] |
| [Function 3] | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | Tie | [Notes] |
| **Price** | $X/mo | $Y/mo | | |
| **Team preference** | [Score] | [Score] | | |

### Decision Framework

For each tool, answer these 5 questions:

| Question | Tool: _______ | Score (1-5) |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| **1. Would we miss it if it disappeared tomorrow?** | [Answer] | /5 |
| **2. Does it do something no other tool in our stack does?** | [Answer] | /5 |
| **3. Do we use it at least weekly?** | [Answer] | /5 |
| **4. Is the cost justified by the value?** | [Answer] | /5 |
| **5. Does it integrate well with our other tools?** | [Answer] | /5 |
| **TOTAL** | | **/25** |

### Scoring Guide
- **20-25:** Keep it. It's earning its place.
- **14-19:** Review it. Can you get the same value cheaper or from an existing tool?
- **Below 14:** Cut it. You're paying for shelf space.

### Consolidation Opportunities

| Overlapping Tools | Function | Consolidate Into | Monthly Savings | Migration Effort |
|-------------------|----------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| [Tool A] + [Tool B] | [What they both do] | [Winner] | $ | Low / Med / High |
| [Tool C] + [Tool D] | [What they both do] | [Winner] | $ | Low / Med / High |
| [Tool E] + [Tool F] | [What they both do] | [Winner] | $ | Low / Med / High |

### The Final Stack

After your audit, this is what remains:

| Category | Tool | Monthly Cost | Why It Stays |
|----------|------|-------------|-------------|
| Everything | **Notion** | $8-10 | Docs, wikis, planning, databases |
| Project Mgmt | **Linear** | $8 | Fast, focused, beautiful issue tracking |
| Automation | **Zapier** | $19+ | Connects everything, reduces manual work |
| Communication | **Slack** | $7.25 | Team communication hub |
| Security | **1Password** | $3-8 | Password management, team sharing |
| **TOTAL** | | **$[Total]** | |
