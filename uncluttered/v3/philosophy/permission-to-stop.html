      <h1>Permission to stop researching</h1>
      
      <p>You've read the comparisons. Next.js vs Remix vs Nuxt vs SvelteKit. Supabase vs Firebase vs PlanetScale vs Neon. Stripe vs Paddle vs Lemon Squeezy.</p>
      
      <p>You've bookmarked articles you'll never finish. Saved YouTube videos "for later." Opened seventeen tabs of documentation.</p>
      
      <p>And you still haven't shipped.</p>
      
      <h2>Research feels like progress</h2>
      
      <p>That's the trap. Every comparison article, every "ultimate guide," every deep-dive into edge cases makes you feel like you're moving forward.</p>
      
      <p>You're not.</p>
      
      <p>You're standing still, rotating in place, examining every possible direction instead of walking.</p>
      
      <div class="quote">
        "The best camera is the one you have with you."
      </div>
      
      <p>The best stack is the one you start with. Not the theoretically optimal one you'll discover after three more weeks of research.</p>
      
      <h2>The 90% rule</h2>
      
      <p>Here's what nobody tells you: 90% of tools in any category will work fine for 90% of projects.</p>
      
      <p>The differences that reviews obsess over? They matter at scale. They matter when you have a million users. They matter for edge cases you probably won't hit.</p>
      
      <p>They don't matter for your MVP. They don't matter for your first hundred users. They don't matter right now.</p>
      
      <h2>What actually matters</h2>
      
      <p>Three things:</p>
      
      <p><strong>1. Can you start today?</strong> Not after a tutorial. Not after reading the docs cover to cover. Today.</p>
      
      <p><strong>2. Can you get help when stuck?</strong> Community size matters. Popular tools have answers on Stack Overflow. Niche tools leave you alone in the dark.</p>
      
      <p><strong>3. Is it good enough?</strong> Not perfect. Not optimal. Good enough to build what you're building.</p>
      
      <p>That's it. Everything else is procrastination wearing productivity's clothes.</p>
      
      <h2>This is your permission slip</h2>
      
      <p>Pick the stack on this site. Or pick something else. It genuinely doesn't matter as much as you think.</p>
      
      <p>What matters is that you stop researching and start building. Today. Not tomorrow. Not after one more video.</p>
      
      <p>Now.</p>
      
      <p>Close the tabs. Pick something. Ship something. You can always change tools later. You can never get back the months you spent comparing them.</p>
      
      <div class="quote">
        The only wrong choice is no choice.
      </div>
      
      <p>Go build.</p>
    </div>
