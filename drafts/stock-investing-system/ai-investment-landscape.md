| Anthropic | Private | Claude | Safety positioning, Amazon backing | Funding race |
| Meta | META | Llama (open source) | Distribution, data flywheel | Open source = no moat |
| Google | GOOGL | Gemini | Distribution, multimodal | Execution speed |

*Note: Pure-play model companies mostly private. Access via cloud/chip layer.*

### Layer 3: AI-Enabled Software

**Enterprise Software** - AI features added
| Company | Ticker | AI Play | Moat | Risk |
|---------|--------|---------|------|------|
| Salesforce | CRM | Einstein AI, Copilot | Data lock-in, distribution | Execution, competition |
| Adobe | ADBE | Firefly, generative creative | Creative workflow ownership | Canva/free alternatives |
| ServiceNow | NOW | AI agents for IT/HR | Workflow centrality | Enterprise spending |
| Palantir | PLTR | AI platform for enterprise | Government relationships, AIP | Valuation, hype |

**AI-Native Companies** - Built from scratch on AI
| Company | Ticker | What They Do | Moat | Risk |
|---------|--------|--------------|------|------|
| Snowflake | SNOW | Data cloud for AI | Data gravity | Competition, costs |
| Datadog | DDOG | Observability (including AI monitoring) | Developer love | Growth slowing |
| MongoDB | MDB | Database for AI apps | Developer ecosystem | Competition |
| C3.ai | AI | Enterprise AI platform | Partnerships | Profitability, hype |

### Layer 4: AI Applications

**Robotics & Automation**
| Company | Ticker | What They Do | Moat | Risk |
|---------|--------|--------------|------|------|
| Tesla | TSLA | Optimus, FSD | Vertical integration | Execution, Elon |
| Intuitive | ISRG | Surgical robots | Installed base, surgeon training | Regulation |
| Rockwell | ROK | Industrial automation | Enterprise relationships | Cyclical |

**AI in Specific Verticals**
| Company | Ticker | Vertical | AI Application |
|---------|--------|----------|----------------|
| UnitedHealth | UNH | Healthcare | Claims processing, diagnosis support |
| Mastercard | MA | Payments | Fraud detection, risk modeling |
| John Deere | DE | Agriculture | Autonomous farming, precision ag |

## Investment Frameworks for AI

### The "Picks and Shovels" Framework
*Who supplies the gold rush?*

**Best for:** Long-term, lower volatility, proven business models
**Examples:** NVDA, TSM, ASML, MSFT, AMZN
**Thesis:** AI needs chips and cloud. These companies win regardless of which model/application wins.

### The "Platform" Framework
*Who owns the distribution?*

**Best for:** Medium-term, some volatility, tech comfort required
**Examples:** MSFT, GOOGL, ADBE, CRM
**Thesis:** AI features get embedded into platforms people already use. Switching costs protect.

### The "Application Layer" Framework
*Who builds the killer app?*

**Best for:** Higher risk/reward, shorter time horizon
**Examples:** PLTR, SNOW, emerging companies
**Thesis:** The real value capture will be in applications. High risk but highest potential returns.

## My AI Watchlist

### Highest Conviction (Core Positions)

| Ticker | Thesis | Entry Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------------|-------|
| NVDA | GPU monopoly + CUDA moat | <$120 | Best pure-play, expensive |
| MSFT | Enterprise AI distribution | <$400 | Azure + OpenAI + Copilot |
| GOOGL | Underestimated AI play | <$160 | Cloud + Search moat + Gemini |
| TSM | Makes everyone's chips | <$170 | Geopolitical discount |

### Growth Satellite Positions

| Ticker | Thesis | Entry Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------------|-------|
| PLTR | AIP platform gaining traction | <$75 | High volatility, true AI-native |
| NOW | AI agents in enterprise workflows | <$900 | Expensive but quality |
| SNOW | Data infrastructure for AI | <$170 | Data gravity thesis |

### Watching (Not Ready)

| Ticker | Why Watching | Concern |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| AMD | GPU competitor | Always #2 to NVIDIA |
| SMCI | AI server builds | Accounting concerns |
| ARM | CPU architecture | Valuation stretched |

## What I'm Avoiding

❌ **Pure hype plays** - Companies adding "AI" to their name/pitch without real AI business
❌ **Unprofitable AI startups** - Most will not survive the funding winter
❌ **AI ETFs** - Diluted exposure, high fees, include garbage
❌ **AI "experts" on social media** - Most don't understand the tech

## How to Track the Space

### Key Metrics to Watch
- **NVIDIA earnings** - Best barometer of AI infrastructure demand
- **Cloud revenue growth** (Azure, AWS, GCP) - Enterprise AI adoption
- **GPU prices** - Supply/demand for training capacity
- **Model benchmark releases** - Who's leading

### Sources I Trust
- **Stratechery** - Ben Thompson understands platforms
- **The Batch** (DeepLearning.ai) - Technical developments
- **Earnings transcripts** - Direct from companies
- **Hacker News** - Practitioner sentiment

## My AI Investment Rules

1. **Use what you know.** I use AI tools daily. That's edge. Don't invest in AI things I don't understand.

2. **Infrastructure > Applications.** In early innings, picks-and-shovels safer than betting on specific apps.

3. **Beware hype cycles.** AI will transform everything AND be overhyped in the short term. Both are true.

4. **Watch the costs.** Training costs are insane. Many "AI companies" will never be profitable.

5. **Execution matters.** Google has the best tech but keeps fumbling launches. Management quality counts.

6. **Concentration is ok here.** This is my expertise area. Comfortable being overweight (30-40%) vs. general market.
