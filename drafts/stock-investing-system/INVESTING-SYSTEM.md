# Clinton's Stock Investing System
## The G.R.O.W. Method

**Goal:** Build long-term wealth through systematic, emotionally-detached investing
**Philosophy:** Quality compounders + selective growth plays + disciplined position sizing

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Time in Market > Timing the Market
You will never consistently predict short-term moves. Accept this. Your edge is patience and compound interest, not day trading.

### 2. Be an Owner, Not a Trader
When you buy a stock, you're buying part of a business. Would you buy this business? Would you hold it for 10 years if the market closed tomorrow?

### 3. Boring is Beautiful
The best returns come from holding great companies through volatility, not from chasing excitement. Unsexy consistent compounders beat flashy moonshots.

### 4. Know Why You Own It
Every position needs a thesis. "It's going up" is not a thesis. If you can't explain in 2 sentences why you own something, you shouldn't.

## The G.R.O.W. Method

### G - Growth Moat Analysis
Before any purchase, identify the company's sustainable competitive advantage:
- **Brand Power:** Can they charge premium prices? (Apple, Nike)
- **Network Effects:** Does it get better with more users? (Visa, Meta)
- **Switching Costs:** Is it painful for customers to leave? (Salesforce, Adobe)
- **Cost Advantages:** Can they undercut competitors profitably? (Costco, Amazon)
- **Regulatory Moat:** Licenses or barriers others can't easily get? (Banks, utilities)

**No moat = No investment.** Period.

### R - Revenue Quality
Not all revenue is equal. Prioritize:
- **Recurring Revenue:** SaaS subscriptions, memberships (Netflix, Microsoft 365)
- **High Gross Margins:** >60% is excellent, >40% is acceptable
- **Revenue Growth:** >15% YoY for growth stocks, >5% for value
- **Geographic Diversification:** Not dependent on single market

Red flags:
- Customer concentration (>20% from one customer)
- Cyclical revenue dependent on economic conditions
- Declining revenue with no turnaround catalyst

### O - Owner-Operator Mindset
Look for management that thinks like owners:
- **Insider Ownership:** Does CEO/founder own significant stock?
- **Capital Allocation:** Do they buy back shares at good prices, not at peaks?
- **Compensation Aligned:** Bonuses tied to shareholder returns, not just revenue?
- **Long-term Thinking:** Do they sacrifice short-term earnings for long-term positioning?
- **Candid Communication:** Do they admit mistakes in shareholder letters?

### W - Valuation Wisdom
Never overpay. Even great companies can be bad investments at wrong prices.

**Valuation Framework:**
| Metric | Cheap | Fair | Expensive |
|--------|-------|------|-----------|
| P/E (growth) | <25 | 25-40 | >40 |
| P/E (value) | <15 | 15-20 | >20 |
| P/S (SaaS) | <5 | 5-10 | >10 |
| PEG Ratio | <1 | 1-2 | >2 |
| FCF Yield | >5% | 3-5% | <3% |

**The Rule:** Would you be happy with 10% annual returns at this price? If the math doesn't work, don't force it.

## Portfolio Structure

### Core-Satellite Approach

**Core (60-70% of portfolio):**
- Large cap quality compounders
- Hold for 5-10+ years
- Low maintenance, high conviction
- Max 10-12 positions
- Examples: Apple, Microsoft, Visa, Berkshire

**Satellite (20-30% of portfolio):**
- Growth opportunities with higher risk/reward
- 2-5 year holding period
- Active monitoring required
- Max 5-8 positions
- Examples: High-growth SaaS, disruptive tech

**Cash Reserve (10-15%):**
- Dry powder for opportunities
- Never fully invested
- Deployed only on significant dips (>20%)

### Position Sizing

| Conviction Level | Max Position Size |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Fortress (core, multi-decade) | 8-12% |
| Strong (high conviction growth) | 5-8% |
| Starter (still building thesis) | 2-4% |
| Speculative (asymmetric bet) | 1-2% |

**Never start full size.** Build positions over time:
1. Starter position (30% of target)
2. Add on dips or thesis confirmation
3. Full position only with full conviction

## Buy Checklist ✅

Before any purchase:
- [ ] Moat identified and defensible
- [ ] Revenue quality high (recurring, growing, diversified)
- [ ] Management aligned with shareholders
- [ ] Valuation reasonable (not hoping for multiple expansion)
- [ ] Position size calculated
- [ ] 2-sentence thesis written down
- [ ] Would be happy to hold during 40% drawdown

**If any box unchecked, wait.**

## Sell Rules

### When to Sell:
1. **Thesis broken:** Original investment case no longer valid
2. **Better opportunity:** Capital needed for significantly better risk/reward
3. **Overvaluation extreme:** Trading at valuations that assume perfection
4. **Position too large:** Appreciation caused >15% portfolio concentration

### When NOT to Sell:
- "It's gone up a lot" (winners can keep winning)
- "Market is scary" (timing doesn't work)
- "Need quick cash" (this isn't gambling money)
- "Everyone is selling" (contrarian thinking wins)

## Psychology Rules

### The Non-Negotiables

1. **No FOMO buys.** If you missed the move, you missed it. There's always another opportunity.

2. **No revenge trading.** Bad trade doesn't require immediate action to "make it back."

3. **Averaging down is earned.** Only average down if thesis strengthened, never just because "it's cheaper."

4. **Red days are opportunities.** Zoom out. Buy fear, sell greed.

5. **Position sizing is risk management.** You can be right on the stock and wrong on size.

6. **Check less.** Daily checking creates daily emotions. Weekly is enough.

### Emotion Checkpoint

When you feel urgency to buy/sell, ask:
- Am I reacting to price movement or business fundamentals?
- Would I make this decision if I couldn't check the price for 6 months?
- What would the ideal investor version of me do?

If unsure, **do nothing.** The default should always be patience.
