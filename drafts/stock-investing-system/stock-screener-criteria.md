# Stock Screener Criteria
## Finding Stocks Worth Your Attention

Use these filters to build your watchlist. Not every stock needs to pass every filter - use judgment based on the type of investment (growth vs. value vs. dividend).

Avoid entirely:
- [ ] Negative gross margins (losing money on every sale)
- [ ] Unaligned management (massive dilution, excessive comp)

- [ ] SPACs (structure is inherently misaligned)
- [ ] Chinese ADRs (accounting risk, delisting risk)
- [ ] No path to profitability with declining growth

## From Screen to Watchlist

When a stock passes the screener:

1. **Read the last 2 earnings transcripts** - Get management's voice, not analyst summaries
2. **Check insider activity** - Are they buying, selling, or neutral?
3. **Google "[Company] bull case" and "[Company] bear case"** - Understand both sides
4. **Wait 48 hours** - If you're still interested, add to watchlist

### Watchlist Categories

**Tier 1 - Ready to Buy:** Fully researched, waiting for price
**Tier 2 - Research Ongoing:** Interesting, needs more work
**Tier 3 - Monitoring:** Interesting sector/theme, not ready

## Weekly Screening Routine (15 min)

**Every Sunday:**
1. Run your primary screen
2. Check for new additions vs. last week
3. Quick filter: any obvious no-gos?
4. Add 1-2 interesting names to Tier 3 watchlist
5. Promote any Tier 2/3 stocks you've researched to Tier 1

**Don't force it.** Some weeks nothing interesting shows up. That's fine. Patience is the edge.
