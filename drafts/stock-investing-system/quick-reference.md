**W** - Valuation Wisdom: Is the price reasonable for the quality?

## The Golden Rules

1. **Patience is the edge.** Activity ≠ returns.
2. **Boring compounds.** Sexy burns.
3. **Know why you own it.** No thesis = no position.
4. **Size is risk management.** Right stock, wrong size = loss.
5. **Check less.** Weekly > daily.
