# Clinton's Sports Betting System
## A Systematic Approach to Profitable Football Betting

## Philosophy

Sports betting is **not** gambling when done systematically. It's:
- Information arbitrage
- Probability assessment vs market pricing
- Disciplined capital allocation

**The Edge:** You don't need to predict winners. You need to identify when bookmakers have mispriced the probability of outcomes.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Value Over Prediction
A bet has value when: **Your assessed probability > Implied probability from odds**

Example:
- Odds: 2.50 (+150) → Implied probability: 40%
- Your assessment: 50% chance of winning
- **Value:** 10% edge → BET

Don't bet on who you *think* will win. Bet on mispriced outcomes.

### 2. Bankroll is Sacred
- Never bet money you can't lose
- Protect the bankroll above all else
- Drawdowns happen; survival is the goal

### 3. Long-Term Thinking
- Any single bet is irrelevant
- 1000+ bets reveal your true edge
- Variance is brutal in the short term
- Trust the process, not the outcome

### 4. Record Everything
- Can't improve what you don't measure
- Data reveals patterns (good and bad)
- Honest tracking kills delusion

---

## The System: C.A.S.H. Method

### C - Calculate Probability
Before looking at odds, estimate your probability:
1. Recent form (last 5 matches)
2. Head-to-head record
3. Home/away performance
4. Injuries/suspensions
5. Motivation (league position, cup importance)
6. Schedule congestion

**Write down your probability BEFORE checking odds.**

### A - Assess Value
Convert odds to implied probability:
- **Decimal odds:** 1/odds × 100 = implied %
- **American odds:** 
  - Positive: 100/(odds+100) × 100
  - Negative: odds/(odds-100) × 100

Compare your probability vs implied:
- Your prob > Implied + 5%? → Potential value
- Your prob > Implied + 10%? → Strong value
- Your prob < Implied? → NO BET

### S - Stake Sizing (Kelly Criterion)
**Formula:** Stake % = (bp - q) / b

Where:
- b = decimal odds - 1
- p = your probability
- q = 1 - p

**IMPORTANT:** Use **Quarter Kelly** (divide result by 4)
- Full Kelly is too aggressive
- Quarter Kelly = growth + survival

**Example:**
- Odds: 2.50 (b = 1.5)
- Your probability: 50% (p = 0.5, q = 0.5)
- Kelly: (1.5 × 0.5 - 0.5) / 1.5 = 0.167 = 16.7%
- Quarter Kelly: **4.2% of bankroll**

### H - Hold to Rules
- Never chase losses
- Stick to pre-determined stakes
- Walk away after 3 consecutive losses
- Review weekly, not after each bet

---

## Bankroll Management Rules

### Starting Setup
1. Define your **total betting bankroll** (money you can afford to lose)
2. This is separate from savings/bills money
3. Track it as its own "account"

### Unit System
- **1 Unit = 1% of bankroll**
- Recalculate units weekly
- As bankroll grows, units grow (compound growth)

### Bet Sizing by Confidence
| Confidence | Edge | Units |
|------------|------|-------|
| Low | 5-7% | 1 unit |
| Medium | 8-12% | 2 units |
| High | 13%+ | 3 units |
| Max | 20%+ | 5 units (rare) |

### Hard Rules
- **Max single bet:** 5% of bankroll
- **Max daily exposure:** 15% of bankroll
- **Stop loss:** -10% in a day = done for the day
- **Winning day:** After +10%, reduce stakes or stop

## Match Analysis Framework

### Pre-Match Checklist
Use `pre-match-analysis-template.md` for every bet.

Quick version:
1. **Form:** Points per game last 5 (home/away specific)
2. **Goals:** Avg scored/conceded last 10
3. **H2H:** Last 5 meetings
4. **News:** Injuries, suspensions, manager quotes
5. **Context:** What do they need from this game?

### Red Flags (Don't Bet)
- Missing 3+ key players
- 3rd game in 7 days (fatigue)
- Derby/rivalry game (unpredictable)
- Season-end dead rubber
- International break return

### Green Lights (Look Closer)
- Home team in form, priced as underdog
- Away team rotation confirmed
- Clear motivation mismatch
- Market overreaction to one result

---

## League-Specific Notes

### Premier League
- Home advantage has decreased
- Late goals common (bet on total goals)
- Big 6 vs Big 6 = chaos (avoid or go unders)

### La Liga
- Home advantage still strong
- Low-scoring games common
- Barcelona/Real away games = banker territory

### Europa/Conference League
- Group stage = rotation galore
- Knockout rounds = different sport
- Research who NEEDS the result

### Serie A
- Defensive football, low totals
- Inter/Milan home fortress
- Away goals harder to come by

## Tracking Your Bets

### Required Fields (Every Bet)
1. Date
2. Match
3. Market (1X2, BTTS, O/U, etc.)
4. Odds
5. Your probability
6. Edge %
7. Stake (units)
8. Result
9. Profit/Loss

### Weekly Review Questions
1. What was my ROI this week?
2. Which markets performed best?
3. Where did I overestimate my edge?
4. Did I follow my staking rules?
5. What patterns am I seeing?

---

## Markets to Focus On

### Highest Edge Potential
1. **Match Result (1X2)** - Most liquid, most data
2. **Over/Under Total Goals** - Goals data is reliable
3. **Both Teams to Score** - Binary, good for analysis
4. **Double Chance** - Lower odds, higher hit rate

### Avoid (Low Edge)
- Correct score (too random)
- First goalscorer (too random)
- Accumulators/Parlays (compound edges badly)
- In-play (emotional, no time to analyze)

---

## Weekly Workflow

### Sunday (Planning)
- Set the week's bankroll
- Calculate new unit size
- Preview midweek fixtures (Tue/Wed/Thu)

### Monday-Thursday (Execution)
- Morning: Analyze fixtures, identify value
- Afternoon: Place bets before lineups leak
- Evening: Track results, no chasing

### Friday-Sunday (Weekend Action)
- Same process, more games
- Saturdays are noisy (lots of markets, be selective)

### Sunday Night (Review)
- Calculate weekly P/L
- Update tracker
- Write brief notes on what worked/didn't

---

## Psychology Rules

### The Mindset
- You are an investor, not a gambler
- Individual results are noise
- The edge reveals itself over time
- Discipline IS the edge

### When You're Losing
1. Check if you followed the system
2. If yes: variance, stay the course
3. If no: reduce stakes, return to basics
4. Never increase stakes to recover

### When You're Winning
1. Don't get cocky
2. Stick to stake sizing
3. Bank some profits (withdraw 50% of wins over target)
4. Review: was it skill or luck?
