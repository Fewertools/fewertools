# Clinton's Bankroll Rules
## Non-Negotiable Guidelines

*Print this. Put it where you can see it. These rules protect you from yourself.*

---

## The Bankroll

**My Betting Bankroll:** £_______ (fill in)

This is money I can afford to lose entirely. Not rent. Not savings. Not emergency fund. 

**If this number is zero, I do not bet.**

---

## Unit Sizing

**1 Unit = 1% of bankroll**

| Bankroll | 1 Unit |
|----------|--------|
| £100 | £1 |
| £250 | £2.50 |
| £500 | £5 |
| £1,000 | £10 |
| £2,500 | £25 |
| £5,000 | £50 |

**Recalculate every Sunday.**

---

## Stake Limits (Quarter Kelly)

| Confidence | Max Units | Max % of Bankroll |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Low | 1 unit | 1% |
| Medium | 2 units | 2% |
| High | 3 units | 3% |
| Maximum | 5 units | 5% |

**HARD CAP: Never stake more than 5% on a single bet.**

---

## Daily Limits

### Exposure
- **Max daily exposure:** 15% of bankroll across all bets
- If I have £1000, max £150 can be at risk in a day

### Stop Loss
- **Daily stop loss:** -10%
- Hit -10%? Done for the day. No exceptions.
- This protects against tilt and chasing.

### Win Target
- **After +10% profit in a day:** Consider stopping or reducing stakes
- Lock in wins. Greed kills.

## The Rules I WILL Follow

### Before Every Bet
- [ ] I have done proper analysis (not just a hunch)
- [ ] I calculated my probability BEFORE seeing odds
- [ ] I found genuine value (5%+ edge minimum)
- [ ] The stake follows my unit system
- [ ] This bet fits within my daily exposure limit

### Things I Will NOT Do
- [ ] Chase losses by increasing stakes
- [ ] Bet to "make back" what I lost
- [ ] Exceed my daily exposure limit
- [ ] Bet on accumulators (parlays) regularly
- [ ] Bet drunk, emotional, or on tilt
- [ ] Bet on matches I haven't analyzed
- [ ] Use money I need for bills/life

## Recovery Protocol

### After a Losing Day
1. Stop betting for the day (already hit stop loss? good)
2. Review: Did I follow the system?
3. If yes → it's variance, stay calm
4. If no → identify what went wrong, recommit to rules
5. Tomorrow is a new day with new opportunities

### After 3 Consecutive Losing Days
1. Take a 24-hour break from betting
2. Review all losing bets analytically
3. Paper trade for 1-2 days before returning
4. Consider reducing to half-stakes temporarily

### After Losing 30%+ of Bankroll
1. STOP immediately
2. Take a full week off
3. Deep review of everything
4. Either: return with smaller bankroll OR acknowledge this isn't working

## Withdrawals & Profits

### The 50% Rule
When bankroll grows significantly above starting point:
- Withdraw 50% of profits over starting bankroll
- Keep 50% for compound growth

**Example:**
- Starting bankroll: £500
- Current bankroll: £800
- Profit: £300
- Withdraw: £150 (enjoy it!)
- New bankroll: £650

### Monthly Withdrawal Target
At end of each profitable month:
- Bank at least 25% of monthly profits
- This is YOUR MONEY. Take it.

---

## Emotional Rules

### When I Want to Bet Big
"I feel confident" is not a reason to exceed my stake limits.
The system already accounts for confidence in unit sizing.
If I want to bet 10 units, I'm probably emotional. Walk away.

### When I'm Angry After a Loss
The market doesn't owe me anything.
Revenge betting is giving money away.
Close the app. Do something else.

### When I'm on a Winning Streak
Winning streaks don't change probabilities.
Each bet is independent.
Stick to the stake sizing. Don't get cocky.

## Weekly Review Checklist

Every Sunday, answer honestly:

1. Did I stay within my exposure limits? Y/N
2. Did I chase any losses? Y/N
3. Did I skip any analysis? Y/N  
4. Am I tracking every bet properly? Y/N
5. Am I still betting with money I can lose? Y/N

**If any answer is concerning → reduce stakes next week.**

---

## Emergency Brake

If I ever:
- Bet money needed for rent/bills
- Lie to anyone about my betting
- Feel anxious/stressed about betting constantly
- Find myself unable to stop

**FULL STOP. This is a problem.**

There's no shame in recognizing a problem. There's only shame in ignoring it.

## My Commitment

I, Clinton, commit to following these rules because:
- I want betting to be profitable, not destructive
- I understand variance and the long game
- I know discipline IS the edge
- I respect my own financial wellbeing

**Signed mentally on:** _____________

*"The goal is not to make money on any single bet. The goal is to make money over 1000 bets. That requires still being in the game at bet #1000."*
