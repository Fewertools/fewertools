# Stock Watcher — Product Strategy

*Turning your app into a revenue-generating product.*

---

## The Opportunity

You've already built Stock Watcher. It has:
- G.R.O.W. scoring algorithm (unique intellectual property)
- Clean Next.js architecture (shippable quality)
- AI-powered suggestions (differentiator)
- Alert system for buy zones (utility)

This isn't another side project. This is a product waiting for users.

## Market Reality

**Market size:** Stock trading apps = $129B market, growing 19.4% annually

**The gap:** Most retail investors are overwhelmed. They have:
- Too many stocks to track
- No systematic way to evaluate quality
- No clear "when to buy" signals
- Paralysis from too much information

Existing solutions are either:
1. **Too complex** — TradingView, Finviz (for traders, not investors)
2. **Too expensive** — Simply Wall St ($120/yr), Seeking Alpha ($240/yr)
3. **Too basic** — Free apps that just show prices

**Your position:** "Simple, opinionated stock watching for patient investors"

---

## Target Audience

**Primary:** The G.R.O.W. Investor

Demographics:
- 25-45 years old
- $10K-$500K portfolio (retail, not institutional)
- Invests monthly or quarterly (not day trading)
- Values quality over speculation
- Has a day job — doesn't have hours for research

Psychographics:
- Wants a SYSTEM, not chaos
- Trusts data but needs interpretation
- Overwhelmed by traditional research
- Looking for "just tell me what's good"

**Why they'll pay:** They're time-poor but financially motivated. $8-15/month is nothing compared to one bad stock pick.

## Core Value Propositions

### 1. **Opinionated Curation**
"We don't show you 10,000 stocks. We show you the 50 worth watching."

Most apps give you everything. That's the problem. Stock Watcher curates ruthlessly using G.R.O.W.

### 2. **The G.R.O.W. Score**
"A single number that tells you if a stock is worth your time."

Proprietary scoring system that combines:
- **G**rowth moat (competitive advantage)
- **R**evenue quality (predictability)
- **O**wner-operator alignment
- **W**isdom in valuation

This is YOUR IP. This is what competitors can't easily copy.

### 3. **Buy Zone Alerts**
"Get notified when quality stocks hit your target price."

Not price alerts. *Buy zone* alerts. Combined with G.R.O.W. score, this means: "This stock you're watching is now both cheap AND good."

### 4. **Zero Noise**
"No forums. No hot takes. No day-trader energy."

This is for patient capital. The app respects that by being calm, minimal, and focused.

## Positioning Statement

**For** retail investors who want quality stocks without the research overwhelm,
**Stock Watcher** is a focused stock tracking app
**that** curates and scores stocks using the G.R.O.W. methodology,
**unlike** bloated research platforms or basic portfolio trackers,
**we** give you a simple, opinionated view of what's worth watching — and alert you when it's time to buy.

---

## Competitive Moats

1. **The G.R.O.W. algorithm** — unique, defensible IP
2. **Design quality** — you're a designer, most fintech apps are ugly
3. **Simplicity as a feature** — "less but better" is hard to copy
4. **AI layer** — suggestions + analysis (can expand over time)
5. **Solo founder authenticity** — small, fast, responsive

## Risk Factors & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Crowded market | Position on simplicity + methodology, not features |
| Data costs | Use FMP tier pricing wisely; cache aggressively |
| Regulatory | No trading, no advice — just information and opinion |
| Marketing | Faceless content strategy (see MARKETING-STRATEGY.md) |
| Support burden | Documentation-first; community Slack/Discord |

---

## Success Metrics (6 months)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| MRR | £500 |
| Paid users | 50-75 |
| Free → paid conversion | 8-12% |
| Churn rate | <5% monthly |
| NPS | >40 |

These are modest, achievable goals. Not "go viral" hopium.

## Strategic Questions to Resolve

1. **Web only vs. mobile app?**
   - Recommend: Web-first PWA, mobile later if traction
   
2. **US markets only vs. global?**
   - Recommend: US first (FMP data is strongest here)

3. **Self-hosted vs. SaaS?**
   - Recommend: SaaS (Vercel + Supabase = simple ops)

4. **When to launch?**
   - Recommend: Closed beta in 2 weeks, public in 6 weeks
