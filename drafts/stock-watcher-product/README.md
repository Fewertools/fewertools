## Quick Start

1. **Read PRODUCT-STRATEGY.md first** — understand the positioning
2. **Review PRICING-STRATEGY.md** — decide on your launch price
3. **Use LANDING-PAGE-SPEC.md** — build your landing page
4. **Follow LAUNCH-ROADMAP.md** — week by week execution
5. **Apply FACELESS-MARKETING.md** — content without personal branding

## Why This Matters

You already built Stock Watcher. The code exists. The G.R.O.W. algorithm exists.

The gap isn't technical — it's going from "side project" to "product people pay for."

These documents bridge that gap.
