# Stock Watcher — Pricing Strategy

*Price for value, not for cost.*

---

## Pricing Philosophy

1. **Simple tiers** — two or three max, not a feature matrix from hell
2. **Value anchor** — price based on value delivered, not cost incurred
3. **Conversion path** — free tier that's genuinely useful but leaves you wanting more
4. **Annual incentive** — meaningful discount for commitment

---

## Recommended Tiers

## Conversion Strategy

### The 5 → Unlimited Hook

Free users hit the 5-stock limit fast. When they try to add #6:

> "You're watching 5 stocks — that's the free limit.
> Upgrade to Pro for unlimited watchlist + buy alerts.
> Your quality threshold is clearly high. Let's find more."

### The Suggestion Tease

Free users see: "3 AI suggestions available" but can only view 1.

> "Upgrade to see all AI suggestions based on your watchlist."

### The Buy Zone FOMO

When a watched stock enters buy zone, free users see:

> "NVDA just hit buy zone (G.R.O.W. 82, 15% below fair value).
> Upgrade to Pro to get these alerts before the opportunity passes."

### The Historical Insight

Show free users their best-performing watches, then:

> "Track how G.R.O.W. scores change over time — only on Pro."

## Why Not Cheaper?

At $8/month:
- 100 users = $800/month = $9,600/year
- That's meaningful but not life-changing

At $5/month:
- Need 160 users for same revenue
- Attracts tire-kickers
- Support burden higher

**$8/month is low enough to be impulse-buy, high enough to signal quality.**

---

## Why Not More Expensive?

You're competing with:
- Simply Wall St ($10/month)
- Seeking Alpha ($20/month)
- Stock Events ($5/month)

$8/month positions you as:
- Cheaper than the "premium" tier
- Not bottom-of-barrel cheap
- Reasonable for the value

---

## Annual vs. Monthly Split

Expect: 60% annual / 40% monthly

Strategies to push annual:
- 18% savings messaging
- "Lock in this price forever" (early adopter)
- Show monthly cost breakdown: "$6.58/month billed annually"

---

## Payment Infrastructure

**Recommended: Stripe + Lemonsqueezy**

Why:
- Stripe handles payments
- Lemonsqueezy handles merchant of record (tax compliance)
- No VAT headaches
- Clean checkout UI

Alternative: Paddle (same concept, different provider)

---

## Refund Policy

**30-day money back, no questions.**

Why:
- Reduces purchase anxiety
- Rarely used (<3% typically)
- Generates goodwill and reviews

---

## Future Pricing Levers

### Team Tier (v2)
- For investment clubs or couples
- 3 seats for $15/month
- Shared watchlist + notes

### API Access (v3)
- For developers who want G.R.O.W. scores
- $29/month
- Opens B2B potential

### Lifetime Deal (Product Hunt launch)
- $199 one-time
- Caps at 200 users
- Generates cash for runway
