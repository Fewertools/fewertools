# Content Strategy — Stock Watcher

*The voice, the pillars, the philosophy.*

---

## Brand Voice

**Personality:** The calm investor friend who does their homework.

**Tone:** Confident but not arrogant. Educational but not preachy. Opinionated but backs it up with data.

### Voice Principles

1. **Data first, opinion second**
   - Always show the numbers before the take
   - "NVDA's G.R.O.W. score dropped 8 points this week. Here's why that matters..."

2. **Teach the methodology**
   - Every piece of content should reinforce G.R.O.W.
   - Readers should internalize the framework over time

3. **Never hype**
   - No rockets, no "to the moon," no guarantees
   - Calm confidence attracts the right audience

4. **Respect the reader's intelligence**
   - No dumbing down, but also no jargon walls
   - Assume they know what PE ratio is; explain what makes G.R.O.W. different

5. **Humble about uncertainty**
   - "The score suggests..." not "This will definitely..."
   - Markets are complex; methodology helps, doesn't guarantee

## Hashtag Strategy

**Use sparingly:**
- #investing
- #stocks
- #stockmarket

**Avoid:**
- #crypto (wrong audience)
- #trading (we're for investors, not traders)
- #financialfreedom (too influencer-y)

**Best practice:** 0-2 hashtags per tweet, in-line is better than stacked at end.

---

## Engagement Strategy

**Daily (5 minutes):**
- Reply to comments on your tweets
- Quote tweet interesting market takes with G.R.O.W. perspective
- Like/reply to investing accounts you want to build relationship with

**Weekly:**
- Find 3-5 conversations about stocks you've analyzed
- Add value with your analysis (don't just plug the product)

**Never:**
- Argue with trolls
- Hype or pump stocks
- Make specific buy/sell recommendations

## Content Don'ts

❌ "NVDA is going to $500!" (predictions)
❌ "BUY NOW!!!" (urgency manipulation)
❌ "I'm bullish on..." (personal position disclosure)
❌ "Not financial advice" on every tweet (defensive, sus)
❌ Multiple rockets/fire emojis (day-trader energy)

## Content Dos

✅ "G.R.O.W. score suggests quality at this price"
✅ "The methodology flags X as a concern"
✅ "Here's how I'd think about this..."
✅ One relevant emoji per tweet max
✅ Clear, calm language

---

## Competitive Differentiation

**Simply Wall St:** Complex infographics, overwhelming
**Seeking Alpha:** Wall of text, ads everywhere
**Generic fintwit:** Hype, noise, positions

**Stock Watcher content:** Simple, methodical, calm, trustworthy

When someone discovers your content, they should think:
*"Finally, someone who explains this simply and isn't trying to pump their bags."*

---

## Metrics That Matter

Track weekly:
- Impressions (reach)
- Profile visits (interest)
- Link clicks (intent)
- Followers gained (growth)
- Mentions/replies (engagement)

Don't obsess over:
- Individual tweet performance
- Follower count (vanity)
- Comparison to big accounts

**The goal:** Consistent growth, not viral moments.

## Voice Examples

### Bad ❌
"OMG NVDA just crushed earnings!!! 🚀🚀🚀 This stock is going to the moon! Get in before it's too late!"

### Good ✅
"NVDA beat estimates by 22%. G.R.O.W. score holds at 87. 

The growth moat strengthened (data center demand), but valuation wisdom dipped (premium expanded).

Quality company. Not cheap. Worth watching on pullbacks."
