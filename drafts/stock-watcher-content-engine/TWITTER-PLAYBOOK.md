### Thread Template 2: Methodology Explainer

**Tweet 1:**
```
Most stock analysis is noise.

G.R.O.W. cuts through it.

Here's the methodology that changed how I evaluate stocks 🧵
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
G.R.O.W. stands for:

🏰 Growth Moat
📈 Revenue Quality
🤝 Owner-Operator
💰 Valuation Wisdom

Four factors. One score. Here's why each matters:
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
🏰 Growth Moat

Can this company defend its position?

I look for:
• Network effects
• Switching costs
• Brand strength
• Scale advantages
• Regulatory moats

No moat = vulnerable to competition.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
📈 Revenue Quality

Not all revenue is equal.

Quality revenue is:
• Recurring (subscriptions > one-time)
• Diversified (not dependent on one customer)
• Growing (but sustainably)
• High margin (pricing power)

Bad revenue looks good until it doesn't.
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
🤝 Owner-Operator

Does leadership have skin in the game?

I check:
• Founder still involved?
• Insider ownership %
• Compensation alignment
• Long-term thinking vs quarterly games

When owners operate, they build for decades.
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
💰 Valuation Wisdom

Good company ≠ good investment at any price.

I look at:
• P/E vs growth rate
• Historical valuation range
• Sector comparisons
• Margin of safety

Quality at a fair price beats hype at any price.
```

**Tweet 7:**
```
Each factor scores 0-100.

Combined = overall G.R.O.W. score.

• 80+ = High quality, watch closely
• 60-80 = Solid, context matters
• <60 = Concerns, be cautious

Simple. Systematic. Repeatable.
```

**Tweet 8:**
```
I built Stock Watcher to automate this.

• Scores for any stock
• Buy zone alerts
• Weekly watchlist tracking

### Thread Template 3: "Why I Don't Use X"

**Tweet 1:**
```
Why I stopped caring about P/E ratio.

(And what I use instead) 🧵
```

**Tweet 2-5:** Build the argument with specific examples

**Tweet 6:** Introduce G.R.O.W. as the alternative

**Tweet 7:** CTA to product
