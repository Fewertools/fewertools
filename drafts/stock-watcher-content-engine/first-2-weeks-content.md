## Day 1 (Monday) — Launch & First Score

### Tweet 1 (Pinned Thread)
```
Most stock analysis is noise.

Charts, indicators, hot takes, FOMO.

I built something different.

Introducing G.R.O.W. — a scoring system for patient investors 🧵
```

### Tweet 2
```
G.R.O.W. scores stocks on 4 factors:

🏰 Growth Moat — Can they defend their position?
📈 Revenue Quality — Is the money predictable?
🤝 Owner-Operator — Does leadership have skin in the game?
💰 Valuation Wisdom — Is the price reasonable?

One score. 0-100.
```

### Tweet 3
```
Why these four?

Because they capture what actually matters for long-term investors.

Not momentum. Not sentiment. Not what Reddit is pumping.

Fundamentals that compound.
```

### Tweet 4
```
I've been using this privately for months.

Now it's in Stock Watcher — a free app to track your watchlist with G.R.O.W. scores.

Simple. Opinionated. Built for patience.

### Tweet 5 (Separate, same day)
```
First public G.R.O.W. score:

MSFT: 84/100

🏰 Growth Moat: 92 (Azure + Enterprise lock-in)
📈 Revenue Quality: 88 (Recurring, diversified)
🤝 Owner-Operator: 78 (Nadella solid, not founder)
💰 Valuation: 78 (Premium, but justified)

Quality deserves a premium.
```

## Day 2 (Tuesday) — First Full Thread

### Thread: NVDA Deep Dive
```
Tweet 1:
I scored NVDA using G.R.O.W.

Result: 87/100

The AI darling is quality. But at what price?

Let's break it down 🧵

---

Tweet 2:
🏰 Growth Moat: 95/100

NVDA's competitive position is exceptional:

• CUDA ecosystem = massive switching costs
• 80%+ market share in AI training chips
• 5+ year head start on competition
• Network effect: more devs → more tools → more devs

This moat is real.

---

Tweet 3:
📈 Revenue Quality: 88/100

The money is flowing:

• 122% YoY revenue growth
• Data center segment = sticky enterprise contracts
• Diversified across gaming, auto, AI
• Gross margins expanding

Concern: Heavy reliance on top hyperscalers (concentration risk)

---

Tweet 4:
🤝 Owner-Operator: 85/100

Jensen Huang is the real deal:

• Co-founder, 30+ years at helm
• Owns 3.5% (~$90B stake)
• Long-term visionary
• Bonus tied to TSR, not just revenue

When the founder owns billions, incentives align.

---

Tweet 5:
💰 Valuation Wisdom: 78/100

Here's where it gets tricky:

• Forward P/E: 32x
• PEG ratio: ~1.5 (reasonable for growth)
• Trading near ATH
• Premium vs semiconductor peers

Not cheap. But for this quality, not crazy either.

---

Tweet 6:
📊 Final G.R.O.W. score: 87/100

Verdict: Exceptional business at a full price.

For patient investors:
• Don't chase at highs
• Watch for 15-20% pullbacks
• The moat justifies a position

## Day 3 (Wednesday) — Quick Take

```
GOOG G.R.O.W. score: 78/100

🏰 Growth Moat: 88 (Search monopoly, YouTube, Cloud)
📈 Revenue Quality: 82 (Diversifying, but still ad-heavy)
🤝 Owner-Operator: 72 (Founders gone, culture remains)
💰 Valuation: 71 (Reasonable at 24x forward)

Verdict: Quality at fair price. Antitrust risk is real.
```

## Day 4 (Thursday) — Educational Content

### Thread: What is a Growth Moat?
```
Tweet 1:
"Growth moat" is the G in G.R.O.W.

It's the most important factor I evaluate.

Here's what it means and how to spot it 🧵

---

Tweet 2:
A growth moat isn't just a competitive advantage.

It's a competitive advantage that GROWS over time.

Most moats erode. Great moats compound.

---

Tweet 3:
5 types of growth moats I look for:

1. Network effects (more users = more value)
2. Switching costs (painful to leave)
3. Scale economics (bigger = cheaper)
4. Brand power (trust > features)
5. Regulatory capture (legal protection)

---

Tweet 4:
Examples:

• NVDA: CUDA switching costs + ecosystem (95 score)
• MSFT: Enterprise switching costs + scale (92 score)
• GOOG: Search network effect + data moat (88 score)
• META: Social network effect, but weakening (76 score)

---

Tweet 5:
How to evaluate moat strength:

Ask: "If a well-funded competitor started tomorrow, how long would it take to catch up?"

5+ years = strong moat
2-5 years = moderate
<2 years = weak or no moat

---

Tweet 6:
The Growth Moat is 25% of the G.R.O.W. score.

Because without a moat, nothing else matters.

Revenue quality, leadership, valuation — all temporary without protection.

## Day 5 (Friday) — Quick Take + Thread

### Quick Take (AM)
```
AMZN G.R.O.W. score: 76/100

🏰 Growth Moat: 89 (AWS + logistics network)
📈 Revenue Quality: 78 (AWS growing, retail thin)
🤝 Owner-Operator: 68 (Jassy capable, not Bezos)
💰 Valuation: 72 (Cheaper than peers)

Verdict: AWS is the story. Retail is the drag.
```

### Thread: AAPL Deep Dive (PM)
```
Tweet 1:
I scored AAPL using G.R.O.W.

Result: 81/100

The world's most valuable company. But is it a quality investment?

Let's see 🧵

---

Tweet 2:
🏰 Growth Moat: 91/100

Apple's moat is legendary:

• Ecosystem lock-in (once you're in, you stay)
• Brand power (premium pricing accepted)
• Services recurring revenue
• Hardware + software integration

The moat is widening with services.

---

Tweet 3:
📈 Revenue Quality: 79/100

Mixed picture:

• iPhone still 50%+ of revenue (concentration)
• Services growing 15%+ (high margin, recurring)
• Hardware cycles create volatility
• Geographic diversification good

Services transformation is working.

---

Tweet 4:
🤝 Owner-Operator: 75/100

Tim Cook era:

• Not a founder, but proven operator
• Owns ~$1.5B in stock
• Supply chain excellence
• Risk: Innovation pace slower than Jobs era

Competent, not visionary.

---

Tweet 5:
💰 Valuation Wisdom: 78/100

• Forward P/E: 28x
• Above historical average
• Buybacks support price
• Premium for quality justified

Not cheap, but Apple rarely is.

---

Tweet 6:
📊 Final G.R.O.W. score: 81/100

Best for: Investors who want stability over speculation.

## Day 6 (Saturday) — Light Engagement

```

```
Tweet 1:
Revenue quality is the R in G.R.O.W.

Not all revenue is equal.
