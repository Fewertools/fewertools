### 5. @Biglummy100's Bachelor vs Relationship Food
**Tweet:** "Relationship food -16,400 / Bachelor food -3,800 / I no go advise anybody again"
**Engagement:** Relatable humor
**Why it worked:**

- Speaks to real Nigerian experience
- No complex setup
**Pattern:** Cost Comparison — real numbers for everyday expenses, punchline is the conclusion

## 📈 EMERGING PATTERNS (New/Strengthening)

### A. **The Hypocrisy Callout** (CONFIRMED HOT)
When a public figure says X then does opposite of X — screenshot/video both statements → engagement guaranteed.
Nigerian politicians especially vulnerable because the contrast is EXTREME.

### B. **Class Exception Rule**
"[Universal truth] unless you have money" format is hitting.
Example: "Men don't care about your past... if you're a millionaire"

### C. **Cost Comparison**
Specific naira amounts for relatable expenses → punchline.
Works because specificity = credibility.

### D. **Valentine's Day Countdown**
10 days out. Pre-Valentine content is starting to trend.
Peak posting window: Feb 7-13 for buildup content, Feb 14 for day-of chaos.

## ⚠️ AVOID TODAY

- **Rema vs Wizkid** — too tribal, fanbases toxic, loses followers
- **Fubara/Wike politics** — too inside baseball for growth account
- **Trump/Epstein discourse** — US politics, not our lane
- **Justin Bieber Grammy** — peaked already, late to party

---

## 🎯 ANGLE FOR TODAY

**Primary:** Oshiomhole jokes (peak Nigerian moment, everyone is talking)
**Secondary:** Valentine's buildup (universal, 10 days out)
**Tertiary:** Lewis Hamilton x Kim takes (rich people discourse)

---

## 🔧 FRAMEWORK UPDATES NEEDED

1. Add **"Hypocrisy Callout"** as formal pattern
2. Add **"Cost Comparison"** with naira specifics
3. Add **"Class Exception Rule"** format
4. Note: Valentine's Week = peak relationship content season (Feb 7-14)
