**Posted (Grammy night):**
1. Kendrick "Drake watching from his bed" QT — pending metrics
2. Tyler "doesn't perform, creates experiences" QT — pending metrics
3. Billie "23 with 10 Grammys, I can't fold a fitted sheet" — pending metrics
4. Grammys "Netflix show making us wait" — pending metrics
5. Kendrick "dissed Drake into a Grammy" — pending metrics

**Initial analysis:**
- Self-deprecating comparisons (Billie/fitted sheet) likely to perform
- Drake jokes = engagement bait
- Quote tweeting @chartdata and @Rap = borrowed audience strategy

**Tomorrow:** Check metrics, identify winner, extract pattern

**Posted (Midday - 11:00 AM UK):**
6. "Davido still at the Grammy afterparty and Portable don already finish recording, mixing, and mastering diss track 😭💀"
