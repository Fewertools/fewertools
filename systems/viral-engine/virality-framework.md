# Virality Framework v1.0

*Last updated: 2026-02-02*
*Based on: Initial research + Nigerian Twitter patterns*

---

## Core Truth

Virality is not random. It's **pattern recognition + timing + emotional trigger**.

---

## THE FORMULA

```
VIRAL TWEET = Hook + Emotion + Simplicity + Shareability + Timing
```

### 1. HOOK (First 5 words decide everything)
- Pattern interrupt — say something unexpected
- Curiosity gap — make them need to read more
- Bold claim — provoke a reaction
- Self-reference — "I" statements that feel universal

**Working Hooks (2026):**
- "Unpopular opinion but..."
- "Nobody talks about how..."
- "The truth about [X] is..."
- "I finally understand why..."
- "[Group] will do anything except..."
- "Normalize [unexpected thing]"
- "Dating in 2026 is just..."

### 2. EMOTION (People share feelings, not facts)

**High-share emotions:**
| Emotion | Shareability | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| 😂 Humor | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Self-deprecating, observational |
| 😤 Outrage | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Hot takes, controversial opinions |
| 🥺 Relatability | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | "This is so me" content |
| 😮 Surprise | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Unexpected facts, plot twists |
| 💪 Inspiration | ⭐⭐⭐ | Wins, comebacks (overused) |
| 😢 Sadness | ⭐⭐⭐ | Loss, nostalgia (context-dependent) |

**Low-share emotions:**
- Generic positivity ("Good morning everyone!")
- Obvious statements
- Pure information without angle

### 3. SIMPLICITY (Complexity kills virality)

**Rules:**
- One idea per tweet
- 8th grade reading level max
- No jargon unless the audience speaks it
- If you need to explain it, it won't spread

**Optimal length:**
- Sweet spot: 100-200 characters
- Threads: First tweet must standalone
- Quote tweets: 50-100 chars (original does heavy lifting)

### 4. SHAREABILITY (Would YOU retweet this?)

**Test questions:**
- Does this make me look smart/funny/aware if I share it?
- Would I screenshot this?
- Is there a "that's so true" moment?
- Does it speak for a group who can't articulate this themselves?

**Share triggers:**
- "Finally someone said it"
- "Tag someone who..."
- Makes a group feel seen
- Gives language to a common experience

### 5. TIMING (Right content, wrong time = dead)

**Nigerian Twitter (WAT):**
- 🔥 12-2 PM: Lunch break engagement
- 🔥 8 PM-12 AM: Peak scrolling hours
- ⚡ 6-8 AM: Morning check (lower but consistent)
- 💀 2-6 AM: Dead zone

**Global/US Twitter (EST):**
- 🔥 9-11 AM: Morning scroll
- 🔥 7-10 PM: Evening engagement
- ⚡ 12-2 PM: Lunch

**Event timing:**
- Breaking news: Tweet within 15 minutes
- Award shows: Live-tweet reactions
- Trending topics: First hour is prime real estate

## FORMAT PATTERNS (What's Working Now)

### A. The Observation
```
[Group] will [do X] and then [contradictory Y]
```
Example: "Men will mass unfollow a girl and then wonder why she doesn't text back"

### B. The Fill-in-Blank
```
Maturing is realizing that ___
```
Engagement: Forces replies, builds community

### C. The Escalation
```
[Normal thing]
[Slightly more extreme]
[Absurdly extreme punchline]
```
Example: 
"How I sleep knowing I:
- Have no savings
- Haven't called my mom in 2 weeks  
- Told my boss I was sick but posted on Instagram"

### D. The Comparison
```
[X] vs [Y] but it's [unexpected comparison]
```
Example: "Dating apps vs meeting someone in person is like online shopping vs finding money in your old jeans"

### E. The Quote Tweet Take
```
[Original viral tweet]
+ [Your hot take / joke / addition]
```
Rule: Add value. "😂😂😂" is not value.

### F. The Thread
```
Tweet 1: Hook with promise
Tweet 2-N: Deliver value
Final tweet: CTA + payoff
```
Best for: Stories, rankings, lessons, lists

### G. The Question
```
What's [something] that [filter]?
```
Example: "What's a green flag that's actually a red flag in disguise?"

### H. The Controversial Take
```
[Hot take that 60% agree, 40% will fight you on]
```
Sweet spot: Divisive but not offensive. Generates quote tweets.

## NEW PATTERNS (Added 2026-02-02)

### I. The Rivalry Take (Nigeria vs World)
When Nigerian artists lose to international competitors, content can:
- Defend Nigeria fiercely (appeals to nationalists)
- Be the "reasonable voice" (appeals to moderates)
- Stir the pot (appeals to chaos lovers)

All three get engagement. Pick your lane but commit.

### J. The Relatable Public L
```
[Celebrity's public failure]
+ [How that's basically me doing regular life thing]
```
Example: "Davido at the Grammys is basically me applying for jobs. Qualified, experienced, well-dressed... and they still pick someone else"

This works because:
- Makes celebrity accessible
- Lets audience laugh at shared struggle
- Low risk (you're not attacking the artist)

### K. The Outfit Commentary
Award show fashion is free content. Rules:
- Roasts work if they're funny, not mean-spirited
- Defenses work if they feel genuine
- "I can't believe no one is talking about..." format creates engagement
- Use images/screenshots when possible

## WHAT'S DEAD (Stop Doing This)

❌ "Good morning Twitter" — nobody cares  
❌ Generic motivational quotes — overplayed  
❌ "Like if you agree" — desperate energy  
❌ Long threads with no hook — no one clicks  
❌ Subtweeting without context — confusing  
❌ Reply guy energy ("Great tweet king 🔥") — invisible  
❌ Posting about posting ("I should tweet more") — meta cringe

## NICHE-SPECIFIC: Nigerian Twitter

**What hits:**
- Self-deprecating money jokes
- Lagos/Nigeria life observations
- Relationship chaos (especially pre-Valentine's)
- "Nigerian parents" content
- Afrobeats discourse (Wizkid/Davido/Burna careful)
- NEPA/light jokes
- Jollof debates
- Football takes

**Language notes:**
- Mix of English + pidgin = authentic
- "Sha", "abeg", "wetin" etc. = connection
- Don't overdo it if not natural

**Accounts to study:**
- @boy_director (storytelling)
- @Maborioshan1 (takes)
- @SavageByNature (humor)
- @DrOlufunmilayo (health + takes)

4. **Pattern update** — Add what's working, remove what's dead
