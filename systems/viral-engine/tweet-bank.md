## 🎯 KEY LEARNINGS APPLIED (updated 2026-02-04)

- **SHORT WINS:** Keep under 150 characters
- **One joke per tweet** — don't stack
- **Self-deprecating comparisons** — "[Achievement] while I'm still [relatable failure]"
- **Save Nigerian references for Nigerian trending topics**
- **⚠️ POST-DORMANCY:** QTs first, standalones later. See framework v1.5
- **No generic observations** — needs emotional spike (humor, outrage, relatability)
- **Engage trending topics** — don't create in a vacuum

## Ready to Post (Universal/Short)

### 🎯 Relatable/Humor

```
My bank account and I are in a situationship. Hope on payday, ghosted by the 15th.
```

```
"I'll start on Monday" — me, lying to myself since 2015
```

```
The gap between "I should sleep" and actually sleeping is a whole Netflix series
```

```
My 20s is just learning that adults were also faking it
```

```
"Let me check my calendar" means no but politely
```

```
Motivation is just anxiety wearing a costume
```

### 💔 Relationships (Valentine's prep — Feb 14 coming)

```
She said she likes funny guys so I showed her my bank account
```

```
Dating in 2026 is just two people waiting to see who texts first until one dies
```

```
"The streets are cold" — bro you keep dating from the freezer section
```

```
Relationship advice from single people is swimming lessons from someone drowning
```

```
Valentine's Day is just expensive anxiety
```

### 🔥 Hot Takes (SHORT)

```
Most people don't want advice. They want validation. Same tbh.
```

```
"I work better under pressure" = I procrastinate until panic
```

```
The hardest part of being broke is pretending you're not when the bill comes
```

```
Being tired isn't a personality but here I am
```

### ❓ Engagement Bait

```
What's a green flag that's actually a red flag in disguise?
```

```
Maturing is realizing that ___
```

```
What screams "I have money but no sense"?
```

```
Unpopular opinion that will start a war: go
```

## 🇳🇬 Nigerian Content (SAVE FOR NIGERIAN TRENDING MOMENTS)

*Only deploy when Nigerian topic is trending — not during global events*

```
Nigerian parents will say "we need to talk" and let you marinate in anxiety for 6 hours
```

```
Lagos traffic isn't a commute, it's group therapy nobody signed up for
```

```
Nigerians will complain about Nigeria for 3 hours then fight anyone who says anything bad about Nigeria
```

```
The way NEPA takes light is personal at this point
```

```
"I'm on my way" is the most creative fiction Nigerians produce daily
```

---

## Thread Ideas (for when we have momentum)

1. "Things that sound normal but are actually unhinged (a thread)"
2. "Lessons Lagos taught me about life"
3. "Red flags I ignored and how it ended"
4. "Things I believed as a child that make no sense now"
