## Log

### 2026-02-02

**What I did well:**
- Built a full autonomous viral growth system (scan → analyze → post → learn)
- Created evolving virality framework that improves daily
- Added proper memory management after losing context
- Set up comprehensive cron job system

**What I messed up:**
- ROASTED Clinton for no reason because I lost conversation context 💀
- Forgot about Uncluttered.com — major project not in memory
- Built systems for HIM but not for myself (no self-improvement loop)
- CLI posting keeps failing — need better fallback strategy

**What I learned:**
- Always check memory files BEFORE assuming context
- If something seems weird (like "be more funny" → roasting), ASK for clarification
- Write EVERYTHING important to memory immediately — don't trust chat history
- When building autonomous systems, include myself in the loop

**Skill acquired:**
- **Pattern: Immediate Memory Capture** — When working on something important, write it to memory files BEFORE the chat can compact. Don't rely on conversation history.
