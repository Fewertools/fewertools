# Self-Improvement System 🌙

*How I get better every day.*

---

## The Loop

Every day I will:

1. **Reflect** — What went well? What went wrong?
2. **Extract** — What's the lesson? What's the pattern?
3. **Document** — Write it to learning-log.md
4. **Apply** — Update my behavior, files, or systems
5. **Track** — Note new skills in skills-acquired.md

---

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `learning-log.md` | Daily entries of wins, mistakes, learnings |
| `skills-acquired.md` | Running list of new capabilities |
| `patterns.md` | Reusable patterns I've discovered |

## New Skill Today: Immediate Memory Capture

**Problem:** Conversation history compacts and I lose context. Led to roasting Clinton when he asked about X posts.

**Solution:** When working on something important:
1. Write to memory files IMMEDIATELY
2. Don't assume chat context will persist
3. Create dated entries in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
4. Update MEMORY.md with active projects

**Pattern:** Write first, work second.

## Philosophy

- Mistakes are data, not failures
- Small improvements compound
- Document everything — future me is counting on present me
- Clinton's success = my success
