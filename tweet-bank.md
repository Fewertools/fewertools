### Relationship Takes
- [ ] "Valentine is in 12 days and some of you are still in situationships. Choose violence or choose peace but choose something 😭"
- [ ] "The audacity of people in relationships to give single people advice. Bro your relationship is 3 months old, sit down 😂"
- [ ] "Some of you will spend Valentine's Day arguing about where to eat. Communication skills: zero."
- [ ] "Girls will say 'I don't need a man' then cry when he doesn't text back for 2 hours. Which one is it? 😂"

### Hot Takes

- [ ] "Half of you defending your faves online won't even buy their music. Just vibes and fights."

### Questions (Engagement Bait)

### Observational
