## Engagement Tactics

### Reply Strategy
- Target accounts: 50K+ followers
- Reply within first 30 mins of viral tweets
- Be sharp, not generic ("lmao facts" won't cut it)
- Add value or comedy

### Timing (WAT)
- **Morning (7-9 AM):** Motivational/hustle content

- **Evening (8-10 PM):** Peak engagement - relationship/entertainment
- **Late night (11 PM+):** Unhinged/horny Twitter

2. **Questions:** "Be honest, would you...?"
3. **Observations:** "The way [relatable thing] is so..."
4. **Lists:** "Things men/women do that [emotion]:"
5. **Story format:** "So I was at [place] and..."
