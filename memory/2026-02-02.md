## Fewertools Logo & Branding Session

Working on logo for fewertools.com (productivity/tools curation site).

### Decisions made:
- Brand name: **fewertools** (one word, lowercase)
- Color: Teal (#0D9488) to match site accent
- Style direction: Superhuman/Framer vibe — bold, confident

### What we tried:
- AI-generated logos (OpenAI) — spelling issues, not quite right
- SVG wordmarks with various fonts (Proxima Nova, Avenir, serif)
- Icon concepts: minus sign, converging dots, checkmark
- Animations: breathing pulse, draw-in, hover effects

### Current state:
- Working on icon + wordmark combo
- Need: better font (not Space Grotesk, not Instrument Serif)
- Need: cooler icon with animation
- Site: `/Users/clinton/clawd/uncluttered/v6/`

### Clinton's preferences:
- Wants sophisticated but bold font
- Wants animated icon that looks cool
- Icon should have meaning to the brand
- Doesn't like serif fonts for this

## Nightly Build (11:00 PM) — Stock Watcher Content Engine 📝

**What I built:** Complete automated content marketing system for Stock Watcher

**Why:** The productization docs from yesterday were strategy — *what* to do. But there was no execution layer — no actual content, no automation, no templates ready to go. This closes that gap so Clinton can start building audience without doing marketing work himself.

**Files created in `/drafts/stock-watcher-content-engine/`:**

### Documentation (5 files, ~35KB)
1. **README.md** — Quick start guide
2. **CONTENT-STRATEGY.md** — Voice, pillars, content philosophy
3. **TWITTER-PLAYBOOK.md** — Full playbook with templates, hooks, engagement tactics
4. **AUTOMATION-SPEC.md** — Technical spec for cron automation
5. **analysis-prompts.md** — AI prompts for generating G.R.O.W. analysis

### Ready-to-Post Content
6. **first-2-weeks-content.md** — 14 days of tweets/threads, ready to copy-edit and post

### Config & Automation
7. **config/watchlist.json** — 10 stocks + posting schedule
8. **config/settings.json** — Automation settings
9. **config/scores-cache.json** — Current G.R.O.W. scores for all stocks
10. **generate-content.sh** — Script to generate daily content based on schedule
11. **logs/content-log.json** — Tracking for posted content

**Total:** ~48KB of strategy, templates, config, and ready-to-post content

**Key insight:** Content was the missing bridge between "having a product" and "having users." The faceless marketing strategy identified this — now there's a complete execution system.

**What makes this valuable:**
- Directly addresses Clinton's marketing blocker (methodology speaks, not him)
- Automation means it runs while he builds
- Ready-to-post content = can start tomorrow
- System learns and improves via performance tracking

**Recommended actions:**
1. Create Twitter account (@GROWscore or @StockWatcherApp)
2. Post from first-2-weeks-content.md manually to validate
3. Set up automation after seeing what resonates
