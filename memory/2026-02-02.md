## Fewertools Logo & Branding Session

Working on logo for fewertools.com (productivity/tools curation site).

### Decisions made:
- Brand name: **fewertools** (one word, lowercase)
- Color: Teal (#0D9488) to match site accent
- Style direction: Superhuman/Framer vibe — bold, confident

### What we tried:
- AI-generated logos (OpenAI) — spelling issues, not quite right
- SVG wordmarks with various fonts (Proxima Nova, Avenir, serif)
- Icon concepts: minus sign, converging dots, checkmark
- Animations: breathing pulse, draw-in, hover effects

### Current state:
- Working on icon + wordmark combo
- Need: better font (not Space Grotesk, not Instrument Serif)
- Need: cooler icon with animation
- Site: `/Users/clinton/clawd/uncluttered/v6/`

### Clinton's preferences:
- Wants sophisticated but bold font
- Wants animated icon that looks cool
- Icon should have meaning to the brand
- Doesn't like serif fonts for this
