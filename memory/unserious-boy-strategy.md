## CONTENT PILLARS

### 1. 😂 Unserious/Humor (40%)
The bread and butter. Funny observations about Nigerian life.

**Examples:**
- "Nigerians when the light comes back after 6 hours" + relatable reaction
- "My bank account and I are in a situationship — it gives me hope then disappoints me"
- "Lagos traffic is just group therapy nobody signed up for"

### 2. 💔 Relationships & Dating (25%)
Nigerian Twitter LOVES relationship content. Valentine's coming up.

**Examples:**
- "She said 'I need space' so I bought her a plot of land in Ikorodu. Now she's not replying"
- "Men will do ANYTHING except just say what's bothering them"
- "Dating in 2026 is just two people waiting to see who texts first until someone dies"

### 3. 🎵 Music & Culture (20%)
Afrobeats discourse, Nollywood takes, Grammy reactions, trending artists.

**Rules:**
- Be opinionated but not toxic
- Wizkid vs Davido = engagement but risky
- Tems, Rema, Ayra Starr = safer engagement
- Always quote tweet official announcements with a hot take

### 4. 🔥 Hot Takes (10%)
Controversial but not offensive. Make people quote tweet to argue.

**Examples:**
- "Jollof rice is overrated. There, I said it."
- "Most 'self-made' people had help they won't admit to"
- "If your ex texts you after 2 years, they just got dumped. Don't fall for it."

### 5. 🎯 Engagement Bait (5%)
Questions, fill-in-blanks, "wrong answers only"

**Examples:**
- "What's something that instantly makes you trust someone less?"
- "Maturing is realizing that ___"
- "Wrong answers only: What's really in suya spice?"

## REPLY STRATEGY (Most Important!)

This is how small accounts blow up. You HIJACK viral tweets.

### Rules:
1. **Be EARLY** — First 30 mins of a viral tweet = prime real estate
2. **Be FUNNY** — Add to the joke, don't just agree
3. **Be QUOTABLE** — Write replies people want to screenshot
4. **Don't suck up** — "Great tweet king 🔥" = invisible

### Target Accounts to Watch:
Nigerian Twitter big accounts — reply to their tweets FAST:
- @boy_director
- @Maborioshan1
- @DrOlufunmilayo
- @Omaborioshan1
- @SavageByNature
- @Zaddy_nomso
- @ObongRoviel

Entertainment/Music accounts:
- @Rap
- @chartdata
- @PopBase
- @NotjustOk
- @TooXclusive

### Reply Formula:
1. **Agree + Twist:** "This is true but also [unexpected angle]"
2. **Self-deprecating:** Make yourself the punchline
3. **Callback:** Reference another viral moment
4. **Escalate:** Take their joke one step further

---

## QUOTE TWEET STRATEGY

Quote tweets > regular tweets for growth. You borrow their audience.

### How to QT:
1. Find trending tweet with 1K+ likes
2. Add your take (funny, contrarian, or relatable)
3. Keep it SHORT — the original tweet is already there
4. Use relevant hashtags if trending

### Tonight's Grammy Example (Working):
You quoted @chartdata about Kendrick and added "Drake watching from his bed like 🫠"
— That's the formula. Borrow the news, add the humor.

---

## THREAD STRATEGY

One thread per week. Threads get bookmarked and shared.

### Thread Formats:
- "Things Nigerian parents say that sound normal but are actually wild"
- "Dating red flags I ignored and how it ended (a thread)"
- "Things Lagos taught me about life"
- "Ranking [popular thing] and I'm not accepting criticism"

### Thread Rules:
- First tweet must HOOK (make them click)
- 5-12 tweets max
- End with a call to action ("Follow for more unserious content")
- Self-reply immediately so thread stays connected

## GROWTH HACKS

### 1. Trend Hijacking
When something is trending, tweet about it within the first hour with a unique angle. Use the hashtag.

### 2. Engagement Pods (Optional)
Find 5-10 accounts at your level. Like/RT each other's posts in the first 10 mins to boost algorithm.

### 3. Pinned Tweet
Pin your funniest/most relatable tweet. It's your storefront.

### 4. Bio Optimization
