## @Unserious_boy Automation Setup

Set up the Twitter growth automation for @Unserious_boy:

**Created:**

**Credentials:** `~/.config/bird/unserious_boy.env`
- AUTH_TOKEN and CT0 stored
- Usage: `bird --auth-token "$AUTH_TOKEN" --ct0 "$CT0" <command>`

**First Run:** Spawned sub-agent for initial posting session
- Target: 5-8 tweets
- Trending topics: Fela Grammy, Wizkid/Burna/Davido, X revenue payouts
- Mix: original tweets + replies + quote tweets

**Strategy (from playbook):**
- 40-60 posts/day target
- Content pillars: Relationships (40%), Money/Hustle (25%), Nigerian Culture (20%), General Vibes (15%)
- Reply under viral posts in first 30 mins
- Voice: Unserious, self-deprecating, Pidgin + English mix
