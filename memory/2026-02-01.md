## Stock Watcher App - Major Build Session 🚀

Clinton asked to build a stock monitoring app that suggests investments. Started ~1:27 AM, built through the night while he slept.

### What We Built (v0.2 - Feature Complete)

**Project:** `/Users/clinton/clawd/projects/stock-watcher`

**Pages (9 routes):**
- `/` - Main dashboard with market overview, AI suggestions, watchlist toggle
- `/stock/[symbol]` - Full stock detail page with G.R.O.W. breakdown, signals, fundamentals
- `/screener` - Stock screener with preset filters (G.R.O.W., Growth, Value, Dividend)
- `/portfolio` - Portfolio tracker with holdings, gains, category allocation
- `/settings` - App settings (API keys, notifications, theme)

**API Routes:**
- `GET /api/stocks/[symbol]` - Full stock data with score
- `GET /api/stocks?symbols=X,Y` - Batch quotes
- `GET /api/stocks?q=search` - Stock search
- `GET /api/suggestions` - AI-powered stock recommendations
- `POST /api/alerts/check` - Check watchlist for buy zones

**Components:**
- StockCard, SuggestionCard, WatchlistTable, MarketOverview
- Navigation (mobile bottom nav + desktop nav)
- SearchBar with keyboard shortcut (⌘K)
- AlertBanner for buy zone notifications
- PriceChart with target line and sparklines

**Core Logic:**
- `src/lib/screener.ts` - G.R.O.W. scoring algorithm (0-100 score)
- `src/lib/api.ts` - Financial Modeling Prep API integration
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Supabase client + helpers
- `src/hooks/` - useStock, useStocks, useStockSearch, useWatchlist

**Database:**
- `supabase/schema.sql` - Full schema with RLS policies
- Tables: profiles, watchlist, alerts, portfolio, transactions, stock_cache, user_settings

**Scripts:**
- `scripts/check-alerts.ts` - CLI for checking alerts (for cron)
- `data/watchlist.json` - Pre-populated with AI stocks (NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, etc.)

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 16 (App Router) + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (dark theme)
- Recharts for price charts
- Lucide React icons
- Supabase (ready to connect)

### To Run

```bash
cd ~/clawd/projects/stock-watcher
cp .env.example .env.local
# Add FMP_API_KEY from https://financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/
npm run dev
```

### Next Steps

1. Get FMP API key and add to `.env.local`
2. Create Supabase project, run `supabase/schema.sql`
3. Connect Supabase credentials
4. Set up cron to call `/api/alerts/check` and send Telegram alerts

### Family Motivation Messages 💌

Set up daily motivational messages to Clinton's family iMessage group (chat ID 80).

**Family members:** Dad, Mum, Marvellous, Eric, Donald

**Requirements:**
- Send every morning around 7:30 AM (with random 0-45 min delay so it doesn't feel automated)
- Mix of spiritual wisdom + general life encouragement
- Must sound human, not AI — like Clinton wrote it himself
- Weave each name in naturally, not as a rigid list
- Vary style: sometimes shorter, sometimes longer; sometimes scripture-first, sometimes a thought

**Cron job:** `family-motivation` (ID: cfd44b13-1ab6-4986-9c41-dc38a8a91f75)

### Earlier Today

- Gave Clinton a 10-leg acca for the football (PL, La Liga, Bundesliga)
- Liverpool, Barcelona, Bayern, Arsenal, Napoli, Atletico, Marseille as core picks

## Nightly Build (11:00 PM) — Productizing Stock Watcher 📦

**What I built:** Complete go-to-market package for turning Stock Watcher from project → product

**Why:** Clinton has built systems for betting and investing (consumption). The Stock Watcher app already exists. But nothing is set up to actually *generate income*. The gap isn't technical — it's productization. This closes that gap.

**Files created in `/drafts/stock-watcher-product/`:**

1. **README.md** — Quick start guide to the package
2. **PRODUCT-STRATEGY.md** — Positioning, value props, target audience, competitive moats
3. **COMPETITIVE-ANALYSIS.md** — Breakdown of Simply Wall St, Stock Events, Ziggma, etc. and where Stock Watcher wins
4. **PRICING-STRATEGY.md** — Tier structure ($8/mo Pro), conversion tactics, revenue projections
5. **LANDING-PAGE-SPEC.md** — Full landing page spec with copy, sections, design direction
6. **LAUNCH-ROADMAP.md** — 6-week plan from polish to Product Hunt launch
7. **FACELESS-MARKETING.md** — Marketing strategy that doesn't require Clinton to be "the face"

**Total:** ~27KB of strategic documentation across 7 files

**Key insight:** The G.R.O.W. methodology is the brand identity. Clinton doesn't need to be the face — the methodology speaks. Content can be analysis threads, automated insights, and product quality. This directly addresses his marketing blocker.

**Recommended first action:** Review PRODUCT-STRATEGY.md, then start Week 1 of the roadmap (get FMP API key, set up Supabase, deploy to Vercel).
