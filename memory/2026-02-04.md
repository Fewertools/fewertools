## Nightly Build (11:00 PM) — Football Value Betting Analyzer ⚽

**What I built:** A complete, working Python tool that finds mispriced football bets using Poisson probability modeling.

**Why this tonight:** Last 4 nightly builds were all Stock Watcher related. Clinton's sports betting interest hadn't been addressed with actual tooling — the Jan 30 betting system was all frameworks and templates, no operational code. This bridges that gap with a real tool he can use this weekend.

**Files created in `/drafts/betting-analyzer/`:**

### Core System (tested, working)

1. **analyzer.py** — Main CLI with 5 commands (scan, match, history, update-stats, test)
2. **models/poisson.py** — Poisson goal distribution model (attack/defense strength + form adjustment)
3. **models/value_finder.py** — Value bet identification + Quarter Kelly staking calculator
4. **dashboard/index.html** — Dark, minimal web dashboard for viewing analyses

### Documentation
5. **README.md** — Quick start guide (10-minute setup)
6. **METHODOLOGY.md** — Complete mathematical breakdown of how the model works
7. **config.example.json** — Ready-to-customize configuration
8. **requirements.txt** — Python dependencies

### Data
9. **data/team_stats.json** — Team statistics cache (populated via API)
10. **data/bet_history.json** — Bet tracking log

**Key technical details:**
- Uses The Odds API (free: 500 req/month) for live bookmaker odds across 15+ bookmakers
- Uses football-data.org (free: 10 calls/min) for team statistics
- Poisson model calculates true scoreline probabilities
- Form adjustment (last 5 matches) with configurable weight
- Value threshold: 5%+ edge required (accounts for model uncertainty)
- Quarter Kelly staking for optimal bankroll growth

**Test results:** Model passes sanity checks:
- Arsenal at home vs Chelsea: 72.8% win, 2.13 xG — reasonable
- Liverpool at home vs weak away team: 89.9% win, 2.93 xG — reasonable
- Value correctly identified when model price > market price

**What makes this different from the Jan 30 betting system:**
- That was theory and templates (how to think about betting)
- This is operational code (actually finding mispriced bets)
- They complement each other: C.A.S.H. method for manual analysis, this for automated scanning

**Potential evolution:** Could become a cron job that sends daily value bet alerts to Telegram. Could also become a faceless product (betting analysis service).

## 🐦 Viral Engine: Nightly Learning (11 PM)

**@Unserious_boy Day 3 (first day back from auth outage)**

**Results:** 2 tweets posted, 0 engagement on both. Rough day.
- "Midweek energy is just Monday with better PR" — 0 likes
- Valentine/WizDavido countdown — 0 likes

**Root cause:** Algorithm deprioritization after 2-day silence. Both were standalone tweets — needed QTs to rebuild algo presence.

**Framework updated to v1.5:** Added POST-DORMANCY RECOVERY PROTOCOL
- After 24h+ silence: QT-first strategy, no standalones until engagement returns
- This is the biggest operational learning since launch

**Tomorrow's plan:** QT-heavy recovery day targeting Cubana Chief Priest, Endrick goal, Ronaldo return. Valentine standalone only if QTs get traction first.
