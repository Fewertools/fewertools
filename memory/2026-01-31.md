## Uncluttered v2 Website
- Fixed dark mode text visibility issues - sections with dark backgrounds (Stay ahead of the curve, Ready to build, footer) now use explicit white (#ffffff) text instead of CSS variables that swap incorrectly
- Fixed dark mode toggle button - consolidated duplicate JS handlers
- Created **Tutorials section** at `/tutorials/` with:
  - Index page listing 6 tutorials (2 coming soon)
  - Full "Build a SaaS MVP in a Weekend" tutorial with code blocks, TOC, tool callouts
  - Tutorial CSS styles added
- Fixed "Try:" suggestion buttons and secondary button text visibility in dark mode
- Created proper logo (`logo.svg`, `favicon.svg`) - gradient star/compass shape
- Updated Stripe logo to proper S icon with brand purple background
- Changed newsletter section gradient from light blue to deep slate (#1e293b → #0f172a) for more premium look

## @Unserious_boy Twitter
- Account rate limited (error 226) - Twitter flagging automated activity
- **Paused cron job** (id: 014b4c41-12bc-450e-a6bc-c2ea8a47732b) until Clinton manually warms up the account
- Clinton needs to: log in via browser, scroll/browse 10-15 mins, like some posts, then we can re-enable

## Family Motivation Cron
- **Issue identified**: Cron reports "ok" but message doesn't actually send
- Had to manually send family message today after Clinton asked
- Need to fix the cron job to verify message was actually delivered

## Football Betting
- Clinton asked for 10-leg accumulator for Saturday fixtures
- Provided picks from PL, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1, Championship
- Key selections: Barcelona, Liverpool, Bayern, Atletico, Leverkusen, Brighton, Leipzig, Napoli, Monaco, Birmingham

## Technical Notes
- When using CSS variables for colors that need to stay fixed regardless of theme (like white text on always-dark sections), use explicit hex values (#ffffff) with !important instead of var(--white) which swaps in dark mode

## Nightly Build (11:00 PM)

**Why this matters:** Stock investing is an interest Clinton mentioned but hadn't been systematized. Combined with yesterday's betting system, he now has frameworks for both income streams that remove emotion and provide structure - which helps with his pattern of losing steam when emotional rewards fade.
