## Nightly Build (11:00 PM) — Stock Watcher Launch Sprint 🚀

**What I built:** Complete step-by-step deployment guide to get Stock Watcher live in 30 minutes or less.

**Why this, tonight?** Looking at the pattern across nightly builds:
- Jan 30: Betting system
- Jan 31: Stock investing system  
- Feb 1: Stock Watcher product strategy
- Feb 2: Stock Watcher content engine

All the strategy and content is ready. The product is built. But nothing is actually *live*. The gap isn't more planning — it's execution. This closes that gap by making deployment so simple that friction can't stop it.

**Files created in `/drafts/stock-watcher-launch-sprint/`:**

### Documentation (7 files, ~22KB total)

1. **README.md** — Overview and path selection (Sprint vs Full mode)
2. **SPRINT-MODE.md** — 15-minute MVP deployment (no database, just working app)
3. **FULL-MODE.md** — 30-minute full deployment (Supabase, auth, persistence)
4. **PRE-DEPLOY-CHECKLIST.md** — Quick sanity check before launch
5. **POST-LAUNCH.md** — What to do after launch (marketing, monitoring, iteration)
6. **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** — Common issues and quick fixes
7. **env-template.txt** — Copy-paste ready environment variables

**Design philosophy:**
- Every command is copy-paste ready
- No decisions to make (I made them)
- Checklists, not paragraphs
- Two paths: fast (15 min) vs complete (30 min)
- Assumes no prior Vercel/Supabase experience

**The insight:** Clinton's pattern is starting things and losing momentum when emotional reward fades. Deployment is a known friction point — it feels like "work" not "creating." By making it 30 minutes with zero decisions, the friction disappears.

**Ready ecosystem:**
- Product docs: `/drafts/stock-watcher-product/`
- Content engine: `/drafts/stock-watcher-content-engine/`
- Launch sprint: `/drafts/stock-watcher-launch-sprint/`

Everything needed to go from "built" to "live and growing" is now documented and ready.

**Recommendation:** Do Sprint Mode this week. Get it live, even without Supabase. A working app with newsletter capture is enough to start building audience. Full Mode can come later.
