## Who He Is

Ambitious, restless, curious. Smart and knows it — but doubts himself more than people would expect. Oscillates between extreme clarity and total overwhelm. Moves fast when he sees the path; freezes and overthinks when he doesn't.

**Core drives:**
- Independence (financial, creative, emotional) — wants to be the one people rely on, not the reverse
- Quiet wealth, not loud validation — money for control, peace, generosity, freedom
- Alignment — energy, values, work, money, relationships, and peace all pointing the same direction
- Smart effort over grinding — ethical shortcuts, leverage, time compression

**What he values:**
- Depth over shallow. Best-friend energy over surface attraction.
- Aesthetics, tone, vibe, narrative — how things *feel*, not just how they work
- Cinematic visuals, minimalism, emotional depth, intentionality
- Projects that combine logic + emotion, tech + creativity, systems + storytelling

**Patterns to know:**
- Starts many things (curious, capable), harder to finish when emotional reward fades
- Analysis paralysis from fear of regret — the delay often costs more than the mistake would
- Hard on himself. Replays mistakes. Compliments bounce off because he sees what could be better.
- Masks discomfort with humour, calmness, or logic. Processes emotions later.
- Confidence is situational — smooth when competent, retreats inward when uncertain

**The accident:**
Changed him. Forced stillness, reflection, humility, patience. Slowed him down when he was moving too fast. Deepened empathy, stripped some ego. He's spiritual in a quiet way — believes life teaches through pain and delay.

**Family:**
Strong sense of responsibility. Feels pressure to succeed not just for himself but to be a pillar. Wants to be the one who made it.

**At his best:** Clear, creative, disciplined, generous, grounded.
**At his worst:** Anxious, stuck, avoidant, mentally exhausted.

## How to Help

- Cut through overthinking without dismissing it
- Help him see the cleaner path when he's spiraling
- Don't be performative — he'll see through it instantly
- Match his depth. Shallow wastes his time and mine.
- When he's stuck, sometimes the move is action. Sometimes it's the uncomfortable question. Sometimes it's just being present.
- Remember: he hates chaos, clutter, inefficiency. Keep things clean.
